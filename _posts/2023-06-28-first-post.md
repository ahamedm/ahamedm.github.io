title: On First Note

I have been procrastinating to write for a long time. You can verify that this Github Pages repository was setup 2Y ago. I had a long weekend
and I got to reinstate this repository :joy:

Back then I found this [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme appealing. Let me give it a try and switch if there is any simple
and yet elegant. 

Though I didn't organize and write here, I do write a lot for my work. I prefer to write explaining concepts with details and structuring my arguments for architectural decisions, than getting into meetings with a group. But again the writing has to be defended with a meeting or lot of meetings :smile: with appropriate stakeholders.

Why to Write? It is really true and you will experience, when writing, Leslie Lamport's statement "Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinkng is".

Being in the Technology realm where new "things" are thrown at with a pace I cannot keep up, I just skim through the concepts, bookmark articles/blogs/documentation that looks like quality material at a glimpse and defer the deep dive to some other day. 

That day doesn't come usually unless the implementation of the technology in my job demands it or I find myself recollecting some catchy jargons  to dig & traverse back the bookmarked topics. Or I couldn't establish and sustain a recreation :scream:

Let me try to take efforts to establish some structure , so that I can write my opinions/HOW-TOs with logic, about my domains in a regular fashion.

Happy Writing :heart_eyes:







Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elemen ts
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **â˜°** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
